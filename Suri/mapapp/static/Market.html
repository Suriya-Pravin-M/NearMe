            Supermarkets are large-scale retail establishments that specialise in necessities and convenience items, offering a wide range of products such as fresh meat, produce, dairy, baked goods, and more. They have become an integral part of our landscape and weekly schedules, with many people shopping at supermarkets every week. They offer a vast selection of products, giving consumers more options for the same item. Customers can find almost all their daily necessities in one place, saving time and effort.
